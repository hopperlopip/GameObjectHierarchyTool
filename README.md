# GameObjectHierarchyTransfer
Small unity tool that allows you extract GameObject Hierarchy and import it in another assets/level file. It just exports selected GameObject and its components. If GameObject has other GameObjects in it, the program will not export their hierarchy, it will export only hierarchy of selected GameObject.

Used libraries:
[AssetsTools.NET](https://github.com/nesrak1/AssetsTools.NET/tree/main) from Nesrak
